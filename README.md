# sgklibs
Various tools and libraries that I've written over the past several years, ported over from Bitbucket.  
Unfortunately not well organized or commented, but it's on my list.


Much of the more recent functionality here will require Andrew Wetzel's gizmo_analysis, rockstar_analysis, and/or 
utilities packages(or my forked/edited versions of his packages), which are publicaly available on Bitbucket.  A 
few functions will rely on the pfh_python package, which is unfortunately not publicly-available at this time.

Just about everything will require numpy, all plotting will require matplotlib, and a few functions are going to
require one or more of:  yt, astropy, pymodelfit, scipy, and probably some I'm forgetting about right now.
